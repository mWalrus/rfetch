# rFetch - minimal system info fetcher

![Demo](./demo.png "Demo")

rFetch is similar to neofetch but without the numerous options and distro specific artworks and it is written in Rust ;).

rFetch is less than 200 lines, only displays what you need and runs in about 18ms currently.


Performance improvements will come :).

Also, any suggestions are welcome!
