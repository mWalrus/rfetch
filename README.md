# rFetch - minimal system info fetcher

![Demo](./demo.png "Demo")

rFetch is similar to neofetch but without the numerous options and distro specific artworks and it is written in Rust ;).
rFetch is only ~200 lines, only displays what is needed and runs in about 19ms currently.

Performance improvements will come :).
Also, any suggestions are welcome!
