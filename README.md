# rFetch - minimal system info fetcher

![Demo](./demo.png "Demo")

rFetch is similar to neofetch but without the numerous options and distro specific artworks and it is written in Rust ;).<br>
rFetch is less than 200 lines, only displays what you need and runs in about 18ms currently.<br>
Currently supports Linux and Windows.

Performance improvements will come :).<br>
Also, any suggestions are welcome!
